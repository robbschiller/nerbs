## Node, Express, RequireJS, Backbone and Sass
This is a starter package for building an application with Node, Express, RequireJS, Backbone and Sass. It's an updated version of [Scott Woosley Biggarts](https://github.com/swbiggart/node-express-requirejs-backbone) Node, Express, RequireJS and Backbone starter template. It utilizes [Andrew Nesbitts](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass) Nodejs bindings to libsass.

There are simple examples of how to write a router, view, and model.  

It's also currently non-functional.
